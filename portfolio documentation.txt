. Initialize DDEV (ddev config) - provide the Project name and the docroot folder
. Start the project (ddev start)
. Installation of the dependancies (ddev composer install) and of Drush (ddev composer require drush/drush)

## Key Customizations

Theme customisation: the Base Theme (Olivero)
    Created a new theme named portfolio
     added the .info.yml file (the required configeration file for Drupal theme creation, containing the theme name - description - base theme - regions - libraries ...)
     the .libraries.yml file holds all the css/sass - js libraries that work to customize/override the global styling and behavior

Module creation
    created a portfolio block custom module
    added a portfolio_block.info.yml file as the required configiration file fo the custom module
    It helps add a custom block to display the latest 3 Portfolio items dynamically
    Also created a PortfolioBlock.php where we provided the namespaces - class - methodes... that help the custom block to display the latest 3 Portfolio items dynamically

Used twig templates:
    node.html.twig - to override Olivero's theme way to display a node
    page.html.twig - to override the olivero base theme way of displaying a page

Used css files to help override the base theme global stylings from the header - body/content - to the footer
